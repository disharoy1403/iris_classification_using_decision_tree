# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification using Decision Tree

This project implements a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict the species of Iris flowers based on their physical measurements. The model is trained on the classic Iris dataset and achieves **100% accuracy** on the test split.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers with four features:
- Sepal Length  
- Sepal Width  
- Petal Length  
- Petal Width  

Each sample belongs to one of three species:
- *Iris-setosa*  
- *Iris-versicolor*  
- *Iris-virginica*  

This project:
- Loads and preprocesses the dataset  
- Encodes class labels into numeric values  
- Trains a Decision Tree model  
- Evaluates performance using accuracy and classification report  
- Visualizes the trained decision tree
